App Parameters take Apps to the next level by allowing administrators to provide customizations
for users who would like to deploy the App, while still maintaining control over the allowable
inputs for those customizations.

An example use case for an App with Parameters could be a simple helm App that represents an
organization's primary business application. The helm chart would define the deployments,
configmaps, and any other kubernetes resources necessary to deploy the application. This
application should be able to be deployed into "dev", "test", and "prod" environments, and the
applications behavior is governed by environment variables (that define the application
deployment stage) configured in a configmap in the deployment. As with any good helm chart, the
chart contains values that allow for configuring the stage of the application. Loft
administrators could expose this App to Loft users, and rather than relying on the users to
properly set a helm value of "dev" or "test", the Loft administrator can instead simply provide
a list of valid options to the user. At time of deployment of the App, the user would be
prompted to select from one of the valid options, and that option would be properly passed as a
value to the chart.

The above example is an overly simplified example meant to give a glimpse of the flexibility of
Apps with Parameters. Parameters can be used to provide a list of valid options to a user, or to
simply accept a text field input. Raw text input can also be validated by a regular expression
to ensure that users are not providing illegal input. The values of these Parameters can then be
referenced anywhere in the App definition!


### Parameter Definition

Parameters are provided as YAML data structures. The following snippet shows a simple parameter
definition that will prompt a user to select from an entry in the `options` list:

```yaml
- variable: mylabelvalue
  label: vClusterStatefulSetLabelValue
  description: Please select the value for the vCluster statefulset "my-label" key
  options:
    - one
    - two
  section: Labels
```

Parameters can also be free-form text fields that are optionally validated. The following
snippet shows an example option that accepts a user input string and validates it against the
`validation` regular expression:

```yaml
- variable: anotherlabelvalue
  label: AnImportantValue
  description: Please enter this very important value
  section: Important Values
  required: true
  validation: "^\w+{8,63}$"
```


### Accessing Parameter Values

The value of Parameters can be accessed in the rest of the App definition. If you have worked
with [go templates](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template), this will be very familiar to you, but
even if you haven't it is quite simple! Values can be accessed in your app using the `{{ .Values.
myvalue }}` notation -- where `myvalue` is the name of in the `variable` field of your
Parameters declaration.

Below is a simple example of referring to a variable named `mylabelvalue`:


```yaml
labels:
  my-label: "{{ .Values.mylabelvalue }}"
```


### Creating an App with Parameters

Creating an App with Parameters can be achieved via the Loft UI.

<Flow id="create-app-with-parameters">
    <Step>
        Select the <NavStep>Templates</NavStep> field on the left menu bar.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Click the <NavStep>Apps</NavStep> option on the templates pane.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Click the <Button>Add App</Button>.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        In the drawer that appears from the right, give your new app a name by replacing the
        'my-app' placeholder name, or by updating the manifest YAML 'metadata.name' field.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Click the <Label>Parameters</Label> to access the Parameters configuration section.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Enter valid YAML representing the Parameters you would like to use with your App.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Make any additional modifications to your App.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Click the <Button>Create App</Button> button.
    </Step>
