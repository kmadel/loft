As outlined in the 'Getting Started -> Explore Loft' section, Loft consists of a number of components that work together to provide you with all the exciting features. These components are part of the Loft Management plane.

Loft CLI allows you to backup these components whenever required. Below Resources will be part of the backup:
- ClusterRoleTemplates
- ClusterAccesses
- SpaceConstraints
- Users
- Teams
- SharedSecrets
- AccessKeys
- Apps
- SpaceTemplates
- VirtualClusterTemplates
- Clusters
- Projects
- VirtualClusterInstances
- SpaceInstances
- ProjectSecrets



To take a backup using the defaults, you can run the following command. This will dump the manifests of all the above listed components to a file in the current directory named 'backup.yaml'
```
loft backup
```

Alternatively, you may specify the name for the backup file by running the command as:
```
loft backup --filename loft-backup.yaml
```

In some scenarios, Loft may have been installed in a different namespace instead of the default 'loft' namespace. You can provide this to the command as below:
```
loft backup --namespace my-namespace
```

You can also choose to exclude certain components from the backup by supplying the names as a comma-seperated string like below. This will exclude users and teams from the backup.
```
loft backup --skip users,teams
```
### Restoring Loft from backup

The backup YAML file contains the manifests for the resources of the Loft Management plane. Hence, it can be used as any other Kubernetes manifest file. 
To restore, simply apply the backup to your cluster using the below command: 
```
kubectl apply -f <backup-filename>.yaml
```
