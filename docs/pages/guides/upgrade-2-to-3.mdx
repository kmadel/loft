This guide briefly covers a few topics that Loft admins may wish to review after upgrading
to Loft version 3. While there are no additional steps required after upgrading Loft, we
recommend taking a look at the topics in this section to ensure that you are getting the best
experience with Loft version 3!


## New Objects

One of the biggest changes in Loft version 3 is the addition of new object types. Take a quick
read through the following sections (and the linked sections!) to get a feel for the most
important new objects.


### Projects

Projects are an organizational unit in Loft, they are a place for you to group your resources,
in Loft 3, you will almost certainly want to be working with Projects as they give you a simpler
mechanism for applying policies to your resources.

Check out the "What Are Projects?" documentation [here](../projects/what-are-projects) for more
information.


### Space and Virtualcluster Instances

Space and Virtualcluster instances are a new resource that further abstracts the space and
virtualcluster types. The *instance* type contains not only information about the space or
virtualcluster, but also information about which connected cluster the space or virtualcluster
resides in. In general, you will want to migrate your spaces and virutalclusters to the new
instance type, this process is outlined below in the [Import Legacy Spaces](#import-legacy-spaces)
and [Import Legacy Virtualclusters](#import-legacy-virtualclusters) sections.


## A New Project

One of the first things you may want to do when getting settled in with Loft version 3 is to
create a new Project. You can use the default "Default" project of course, but we generally
advise Loft admins to create projects that are meaningful to them and their environment rather
than simply using the default/placeholder project.

Read about creating projects [here](../projects/create).


## Import Legacy Spaces

Legacy spaces can be imported into the new improved space instance type from the Loft UI or via the
Loft CLI. One advantage of importing legacy spaces is that they will properly show up in your
desired Project (as spaceinstances are always associated with a project!).

The process for importing legacy spaces is documented [here](../spaces/import-namespaces).


## Import Legacy Virtualclusters

Just like legacy spaces, legacy virtualclusters can be imported into a project. It is a good
idea to get this done after the upgrade process!

Follow the documentation [here](../virtual-clusters/import-vclusters) to import legacy
virtualclusters.
