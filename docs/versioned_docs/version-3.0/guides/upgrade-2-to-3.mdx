This guide briefly covers a few topics that Loft admins may wish to review before upgrading
to Loft version 3. We recommend taking a look at the topics in this section to ensure that you are getting the best
experience with Loft version 3.


## Breaking Changes in Loft v3

* We removed all kiosk apis that were deprecated in Loft v2, please use the new project api instead. This includes:
  * Account
  * Security Templates
  * Cluster Account Templates
* `loft sleep` is now `loft sleep space`
* `loft wakeup` is now `loft wakeup space`
* Grafana integration was removed. We felt that this wasn't providing much benefit and users rarely used this. Please use Grafana directly if you were using this.
* Template syncing in non project spaces / virtual clusters was removed, please import the spaces / virtual clusters into a project to sync the templates
* Space Constraints are now deprecated, please use projects instead

## New Objects

One of the biggest changes in Loft version 3 is the addition of new object types. Take a quick
read through the following sections (and the linked sections!) to get a feel for the most
important new objects.


### Projects

Projects are an organizational unit in Loft, they are a place for you to group your resources,
in Loft 3, you will almost certainly want to be working with Projects as they give you a simpler
mechanism for applying policies to your resources.

Check out the "What Are Projects?" documentation [here](../projects/what-are-projects) for more
information.


### Space and Virtual Cluster Instances

Space and Virtual Cluster instances are a new resource that further abstracts the space and
virtual cluster types. The *instance* type contains not only information about the space or
virtual cluster, but also information about which connected cluster the space or virtual cluster
resides in. In general, you will want to migrate your spaces and virtual clusters to the new
instance type, this process is outlined below in the [Import Legacy Spaces](#import-legacy-spaces)
and [Import Legacy Virtualclusters](#import-legacy-virtualclusters) sections.

This makes it possible to give users only access to a virtual cluster without giving them any access
to the host cluster.


## A New Project

One of the first things you may want to do when getting settled in with Loft version 3 is to
create a new Project. You can use the default "Default" project of course, but we generally
advise Loft admins to create projects that are meaningful to them and their environment rather
than simply using the default/placeholder project.

Read about creating projects [here](../projects/create).


## Import Legacy Spaces

Legacy spaces can be imported into the new improved space instance type from the Loft UI or via the
Loft CLI. One advantage of importing legacy spaces is that they will properly show up in your
desired Project (as spaceinstances are always associated with a project!).

The process for importing legacy spaces is documented [here](../spaces/import-namespaces).


## Import Legacy Virtual Clusters

Just like legacy spaces, legacy virtualclusters can be imported into a project. It is a good
idea to get this done after the upgrade process!

Follow the documentation [here](../virtual-clusters/import-vclusters) to import legacy
virtual clusters.
